> CalculatePurchase function documentation

## Create a shopping list according to the following structure:
```
const buyList = [
  {
    name : "camisa",
    quantity : 3,
    price : 2000
  },
  {
    name : "shorts",
    quantity : 2,
    price : 2700
  },
  {
    name : "meia",
    quantity : 10,
    price : 500
  }
]
```

## Create an email list according to the following structure:
```
const emailsList = [
  "emaill@example.com",
  "email2@example.com",
  "email3@example.com",
  "email4@example.com",
  "email5@example.com",
  "email6@example.com",
  "email7@example.com",
  "email8@example.com",
  "email9@example.com",
]
```

## how do I test the function

I place the index.js file inside a folder and open it in vscode through the integrated vscode terminal I run *node index.js* the result will be generated by *console.log(mapa)*

## error messages 

"Não há itens" - occurs when a position in the Shopping List array has not been filled. To resolve, fill in all the positions in the Shopping List array

"Não há Emails" - occurs when a position in the Email List array has not been filled. To resolve, fill all the positions in the Email List array

## how the function works

The function will receive a shopping list and an email list as parameters, then it will check if there are empty fields in the arrays received as a parameter, if all positions of the received arrays are filled, the function will add the total of the shopping list invoking the external function **_totalPerItem_** and assigning the total to a const, then the external function **_divide_** will be requested and will receive as arguments the const with the return of the function **_totalPerItens_** and the Length attribute of the Email List, the function **_divide_** will return an array with the total of the Shopping List divided by the size of the Email List, the function will also generate the rest of the division and add the 0 position of the return array, then an empty object of type *Map* will be created and assigned to a const, then the function **_createMap_** will be invoked that will create a map with the same size as our Email List, using email as a key pointing to the value that will be the result of the function **_divide_** ,then this map will be assigned to a const, that const with the assigned map will be inserted within a **console.log()** and the result of the calculatePurchase function will be displayed on the console.
